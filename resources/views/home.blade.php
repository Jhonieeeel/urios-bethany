                    Bethany Home has been operating since late 1996. Initially focused on supporting urban poor
                    women
                    through livelihood projects, it shifted its mission to provide urgent shelter for female
                    child
                    victims. The name 'Bethany Home' is inspired by the New Testament's Bethany in Jerusalem, a
                    place
                    where Jesus found refuge and friendship with Lazarus, Martha, and Mary.

                <p class=" max-w-5xl mx-auto font-light px-3">
                    In this program, Lazarus symbolizes the resurrection and new life that survivors can achieve
                    after
                    their traumatic experiences. Mary represents contemplation and prayer, guiding survivors
                    toward
                    holistic recovery and healing. Martha embodies hard work and dedication, encouraging
                    residents
                    to
                    develop skills and work towards a productive and renewed life.
